"""``HealthSampler``: runs the probes on its own cadence and caches the result.

Why a worker thread and a cache instead of probing when the entity is built?
The publish loop runs at 1 Hz and the entity expires 10 s after its last
publish, so the publish path must be near-instant, and probes are not (a
``vcgencmd`` subprocess, an HTTP call to MediaMTX). Sampling every few
seconds on a worker thread and publishing the last snapshot keeps the
heartbeat safe, and the snapshot's ``sampled_at`` tells consumers how fresh
it is.

The sampler is a ``Service`` worker: ``run(stop)`` loops until the stop event
is set. It is also usable synchronously (``sample_once``) so ``main.py`` can
take a first sample before the service starts and tests need no thread.

Logging is change-driven: a component's status is logged at INFO only when it
differs from the previous round, so a steady state is silent and the journal
reads as a timeline of transitions.
