"""The entity id: a UUID that stays the same across restarts and reinstalls.

An asset must keep one id for its whole life or operators see a new camera
at every restart while the old one expires. Three sources, in order of precedence:

1. ``ENTITY_ID`` from config, when set. It must be a UUID (checked by
   ``Config.validate``) and it wins over everything, so an operator can pin
   the id or move it between boards.
2. The id recorded in ``state.json`` by an earlier run. Whatever was
   published before is what keeps being published.
3. A UUID derived from the board: ``uuid5`` over the Pi's hardware serial in
   this integration's namespace. It needs no state and is the same after a
   reinstall or a lost SD card, as long as the same board is used.

Without a serial (development off a Pi) a random ``uuid4`` is generated once
and persisted, which is stable for as long as ``state.json`` survives.
