"""The media pipeline: how the stream is started, stopped, and observed.

``CameraControl`` decides *whether* the stream should be running; a
``MediaPipeline`` is *how* that is done on this machine, behind a three-method
seam so the control logic and its tests never touch systemd or MediaMTX:

* ``start(push_url)`` / ``stop()`` make the pipeline push to (or stop pushing
  to) the given SRT ingress. They may take a while and may fail; failures are
  ``PipelineError`` with a message fit for a task's ``error_message``.
* ``status()`` reports what is **observed** (is the camera path producing
  frames, is the pusher attached and moving bytes), never what was intended.
  It must be cheap and must never raise, because the 1 Hz publish loop and the
  health sampler call it and neither may stall.

``CommandPipeline`` is the deployment shipped with this repo: the ``Start`` /
``Stop`` tasks run shell commands (``TASK_START_COMMAND`` /
``TASK_STOP_COMMAND``, typically ``sudo systemctl restart|stop mediamtx-srt``;
``restart`` rather than ``start`` so MediaMTX re-reads the SRT target on every
Start) and a ``MediaMtxStatusProbe`` reads MediaMTX's control API for the
observed state. An empty command makes the transition state-only, which is how
the service is developed off the Pi. The push URL is also exported as
``SRT_TARGET`` into the command's environment: harmless for the systemd case
(the unit reads it from the ``EnvironmentFile`` the ingress writes) and handy
for ad-hoc commands such as a bare ``ffmpeg`` line.

The probe is read-only. Driving MediaMTX through its API (patching
``runOnReady`` and friends) is deliberately not done here: systemd owns the
pusher process, the daemon only asks it to start or stop.

    ``GET {api_url}/v3/paths/get/{path}`` describes one MediaMTX path: whether
    its source is ``ready`` (frames arriving from the camera), how many
    ``bytesReceived`` from that source so far, and the ``readers`` attached to
    it (the SRT pusher launched by ``runOnReady`` shows up as one).

    Mapping:

    * ``ready`` is the path's ``ready`` flag.
    * ``pushing`` is ``True`` when there is at least one reader **and**
      ``bytesReceived`` grew since the previous successful sample. A reader
      alone is not enough: a wedged pusher stays attached while nothing flows.
      With readers but no earlier sample to compare against (first sample, or
      the counter went backwards because MediaMTX restarted) it is ``None``;
      with no readers it is ``False`` regardless of the counter.
    * Anything that stops us reading the path (connection refused, timeout,
      malformed JSON) yields ``ready=None, pushing=None`` with the reason in
      ``detail``. The one exception is an HTTP 404, which MediaMTX returns for
      a path that is not active at all: that is a definite ``ready=False``.

    Samples are cached for ``ttl_s`` so several 1 Hz callers share one request,
    and the request itself has a short ``timeout_s`` so a hung API cannot stall
    the publish loop. ``status()`` never raises.
