"""Lattice video ingress lifecycle for the camera.

``VideoIngress`` owns exactly one SRT ingress at a time:

* ``create()`` registers a new ingress with Lattice's VideoManager under a
  fresh client-side id, writes the SRT push URL to the ``EnvironmentFile`` the
  MediaMTX unit loads (``SRT_TARGET=<url>``), and records the ingress in the
  ``StateStore`` so it survives the process.
* ``delete()`` archives that ingress (``DeleteIngressStream`` archives rather
  than deletes: the record stays retrievable but stops accepting frames),
  clears the persisted record, and forgets its id.
* ``recover()`` runs once at boot: if the previous process died with an
  ingress still registered (crash, power loss, ``kill -9``), the persisted
  record names it and we archive it so Lattice is not left with a stream nobody
  pushes to. Best-effort: on failure the record is kept so the next boot tries
  again.

A new id per ``create()`` matters: archived records persist under their id, so
reusing one across a Stop/Start cycle is not safe. The id we *send* is a UUID,
but the id Lattice *returns* is server-shaped (``<client id>#<suffix>``,
observed live), so the returned id is the one we advertise, persist, and
archive by. The current id (or ``None`` when no ingress exists) is what the
entity advertises as its ``Media`` item, so the stale reference disappears from
the entity on the next publish after a ``delete()``.

Locking: the RPCs run **outside** the lock, which only guards ``_info``. That
keeps ``video_id`` / ``info`` non-blocking for the 1 Hz publish loop even while
a 30 s VideoManager call is in flight. ``create`` / ``delete`` / ``recover``
are therefore not safe to overlap with each other; ``CameraControl``
serialises them with its transition lock.
